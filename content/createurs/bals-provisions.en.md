Bals Provisions is a preserving company based out of Montreal, Quebec. Working in small batches, Crystal is dedicated to producing family recipes and developing original and delicious products. Her goals are simple: to work with Quebec farmers to promote the wondrous bounty of Quebec-grown produce, and to provide low- sugar, high-flavor jams, sauces and pickles.

Crystal has worked as a baker and pastry chef for over a decade. Upon discovering a citrus pectin that allowed the creation of low-sugar jam recipes that are packed with real and natural fruit flavor and texture, Bals Provisions was launched. With just four recipes, Strawberry Balsamic Jam, Blueberry Lime Jam, It’s My Jam (Rhubarb, Strawberry and Lemon) and the ever-popular sugar-free Apple Butter, the business has grown to include various pickled vegetables, savory sauces, and the signature product Boozetella – a chocolate and hazelnut sauce with the “adult” twist of Cabernet Sauvignon. It’s her best-selling product, year-round, hands-down.
